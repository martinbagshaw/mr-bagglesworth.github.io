Application for Founders &amp; Coders

## to do (from lighthouse audit). _Not all are achievable_:
 - next gen img formats (jpeg 2000)
 - ensure text is visible during webfont load (fontawesome only)
 - service worker stuff (prompt to install, register a service worker, splash page)
 - prevent screen reader from reading out 'Greater than' on links at the bottom of the page

## done:
 - rel = noopener on links (links to cross-origin destinations)
 - theme colour meta tag
 - background and foreground colours against blue and green link text (larger text)
