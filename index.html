        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am applying for the winter 2018 cohort of Founders and Coders because I want to learn, problem solve, 
          and collaborate on projects with similarly-minded people in the future.</p>
        
        <p>I am someone who is not new to coding. When searching for Graphic Design jobs after leaving university 
          in 2011, it seemed that more often than not, some experience with HTML and CSS would be required in the 
          job specification. I took time to learn with online resources, got in to WordPress development, and built 
          up a small portfolio from freelancing, before working in two full time roles that involved a mix of print 
          and digital design, and one in which the duties were fully digital.</p>
        
        <p>Over time, I have become more fond of the web development side of work for several reasons. I like the 
          learning process, and the feeling of progression that learning a new coding language or creating something 
          new and exciting on the web gives me. I like digging into a subject, understanding it, and working out why 
          things are the way they are. I also find the scope of possibilities for what you can do with modern front 
          end development quite inspiring.</p>

  <div id="why">
    <div class="container padded cols-two">
      <div></div>
      <div>
        <h2>So you are already a developer. <strong>Why Apply?</strong></h2>
        <p>A common theme throughout my code learning process is that I have almost exclusively been doing it 
          alone and in isolation, even when working as a full time employee. This was particularly the case in 
          my last full time role, in which I had the task of working on apps and software for large touchscreens, 
          something I was quite clear I had no prior experience in, but was hired for anyway. Unfortunately, 
          I failed to live up to my manager’s expectations, and I did not get taken on as a full time employee 
          after my probationary period. On the plus side, I did teach myself a lot more technically, got exposure 
          to working in a larger company, and learnt that I most certainly do not want to work on large projects 
          on my own in the future, especially when they are borne out of a political need, rather than necessity.</p>

        <p>After reading up on the Founders and Coders programme and attending a couple of the meetups, I think 
          I have found a great opportunity to get involved with a collective of people who want to help each other 
          learn, and in an open and friendly environment. Engaging in the prerequisite materials, especially CodeWars 
          Katas, has given me a greater insight into problem solving techniques for more complex coding problems, 
          pushing me to think in a more structured way.</p>

        <p>Should I get accepted on to the course, I would hope to contribute to other people’s development as much 
          as I can, become a better problem solver, and form relationships with others on the course with a view to 
          working together in the future. In the future, I want to be part of a working environment where people pool 
          their skills to produce work which is beyond the level that any one individual could produce - ‘beyond the 
          sum of their parts.’</p>

      <h2>What else?</h2>
      <p>I have always maintained creative hobbies and enjoyed the outdoors, with the latter taking priority over 
        the former as I have got older (and more bound to a desk!)</p>

          </div>
          <p>I used to draw and paint when younger, but now have settled into making stencil art once or twice a year. 
            This is something I made earlier this year. It is based on a couple of photos I took on a trip to the Hebrides.<br>

          <p>I quite like going rock climbing, having got into it when starting university, nearly 10 years ago.
