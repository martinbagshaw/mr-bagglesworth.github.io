      <h1>My application for Founders &amp; Coders</h1>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hello, my name is Martin Bagshaw, a.k.a. Mr. Bagglesworth. I felt like using a pseudonym (for once in my life) when signing up to Github. 
        I guess I have a bit of a fondness for the Austin Powers movies.</p>
        <i class="fa center fa-venus-mars"></i>
        
        <p>I am not a newbie to coding, having been picking up knowledge, and working on websites since 2012. As a Graphic Design graduate
        looking for a job, learning some HTML and CSS felt like a necessity, as did knowledge of a CMS, such as WordPress.</p>
        
        <p>After building up a modest freelance portfolio, I landed my first 9-5 job, working on generally basic websites for small businesses. 
          After around 18 months, I left for a new role, with the promise of a more varied workload, including graphic design and IT support work. 
          Unfortunately, finding the working environment somewhat stifling and unsupportive, I left after a year, opting for a breath of fresh air: 
          going travelling for a few months, visiting family in the USA.</p>
          <i class="fa center fa-plane"></i>
        
        <p>Upon my return in early 2017, I took online courses with Treehouse in Web Design and JavaScript programming, alongside continuing with 
        some freelance work, and applying for full time roles. I sought to focus more on front end development than traditional graphic design, as 
          I was (and still am) inspired by what you can build with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, something which I have come to gain more 
          satisfaction from than tweaking designs, which often must confirm to personal tastes.</p>
        
        <p>In August of 2017, I landed a new job as a Digital Designer at UCAS, with duties including but not limited to designing, maintaining, 
          and creating apps and programs to work on touchscreen devices, something I was clear I had no experience of in my interview, but I was 
          told I would be given time to learn. I poured a lot of time into learning the required technology and meeting with stakeholders to formulate
          a firm brief for an app. With narrow goalposts to aim for - that missed the main task that students need an app for, this duty was verbally taken
          off my list late in the year. Shortly after returning to work in 2018, I was dismissed. This came as quite a shock, for my boss told me earlier 
          in the week that the purpose of the meeting was to 'reaffirm my objectives.' I was also close to completion on my touchscreen project, 
          an interactive floor plan to display information to students at open day events.</p>
        
        <p>A common theme throughout my code learning process (until coming along to a couple of Founders and Coders Meet-ups) is that I have 
          largely been doing it alone, in isolation, seeing the problem through my eyes only. Aside from being a bit lonely, this is a flawed 
          approach, one which I wish to put an end to, especially after events earlier this year. I hope to collaborate with, rather than work for others 
          on all future projects I am involved with. I want to be in an environment where people pool their skills to produce work which is beyond the 
          level that any one individual could produce. Last but not least, I want to work and learn with others who are keen on maintaining an open discourse,
          and mutually supportive environment.</p>

        <p>Since my time at UCAS, I have done a little bit of soul searching, spending a little more time 
          <a target="_blank" href="http://stencils.martinbagshaw.co.uk/">creating stencil artwork</a>, considering other lines of work, and picking up a 
          bit of farm work (something I have done on and off for the past decade). One thing I have not stopped doing however is thinking of and planning creative 
          projects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/t2XJIxJMa7Xi67PIYDoRrz/Knots---desktop?node-id=0%3A1">such as this app for climbing knots</a>, 
          or building things such as this app-like <a target="_blank" href="http://logbook.martinbagshaw.co.uk/">implementation of my climbing logbook</a> (disclaimer: 
          it grinds to a halt on android chrome!). <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/showlog.php?id=152526">This uses information supplied from here</a>. 
          If you had not guessed, climbing is a big passion of mine!
